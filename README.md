# Eye-bot
This python script runs in Python 3.9 and reminds you every 5 minutes to blink your eyes and every 20 minutes to do an eye exercise (Focus a point far away, switch to a point close by, switch a few times to exercise your lens muscles)

It also enables the greyscale filter as soon night light is turned on. Install the pyautogui, time and PyQt5 packages (winreg is also required but usually part of python installation).

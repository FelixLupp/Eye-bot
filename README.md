# Eye-bot
This python script runs in Python 3.9 and reminds you every 5 minutes to blink your eyes and every 20 minutes to do an eye exercise (Focus a point far away, switch to a point close by, switch a few times to exercise your lens muscles)

It also enables the greyscale filter as soon night light is turned on. Install the pyautogui, time and PyQt5 packages (winreg is also required but usually part of python installation).

Create a shortcut of the .py file and paste it into the startup folder (C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) to automatically start. Choose your python installation as default 'open with' option for the .pyw file. There will not be a console window open, if you wish to have one rename the file extension to .py.
